          "Total BS": "A document living in its own universe. Makes bold claims about market dominance with zero connection to actual business strategy. Like someone built a product roadmap without ever speaking to leadership or understanding company goals.",
          "Fair Amount of BS": "Strategic objectives mentioned as a formality, then promptly forgotten. Features listed without explaining their connection to business outcomes. Stakeholders will waste hours in meetings trying to figure out why they're building any of this.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Makes gestures toward business alignment with vague references to 'driving growth' or 'expanding market share' without specifying which metrics matter or by how much. The connection is there but too tenuous to drive real alignment.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Shows clear understanding of business objectives with most requirements tied to strategic goals. Some targets remain implied rather than explicitly quantified. The 'why' is mostly clear, though a few items need tighter connections.",
          "Absolutely Zero BS": "Every single requirement explicitly connected to specific strategic goals with measurable KPIs. A perfect line of sight from company strategy to product features. Even the CEO would immediately understand how this product drives business outcomes."

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Frustratingly vague to the point of uselessness. Every section raises more questions than it answers. The author seems confused about their own ideas, and now everyone else is too. Will require endless clarification meetings.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Islands of clarity in a sea of ambiguity. Product scope might be clear while timelines float in the void. You could build something from this document, but it won't be what anyone actually intended.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Generally clear with only minor gaps that won't derail implementation. All key components present, though some details require clarification. Engineers can get started while PM answers the few remaining questions.",
          "Absolutely Zero BS": "A masterpiece of clarity where every element is precisely articulated. Scope, timeline, roles, and deliverables detailed with surgical precision. Could be handed to a new team member who would immediately understand exactly what to build and why."

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Pays lip service to users before launching into features the team wants to build. Technical specifications dominate with barely a mention of actual user needs. The perfect document for building a product no one asked for.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Makes an attempt at user-centricity but relies more on assumptions than evidence. Some pain points identified, but they feel like educated guesses rather than insights from actual research. The user exists here, but as a shadowy figure.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Genuinely user-focused with most features tied to validated user needs. Research informs most decisions, though some newer user segments lack the same depth of understanding. Shows good but not perfect customer empathy.",
          "Absolutely Zero BS": "Built entirely around meticulously researched customer personas and validated use cases. Every single feature addresses a documented user pain point with supporting evidence. The user's voice echoes through every page."

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Requirements so vague they could be interpreted in a dozen different ways. The perfect setup for the PM to say 'that's not what I meant' after weeks of development. Will lead to wasted effort and missed deadlines.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Provides a starting point but leaves too much open to interpretation. Technical teams will need to fill in substantial blanks and make assumptions that may or may not be correct. Prepare for mid-sprint pivots.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Gives clear direction with only a few areas needing additional detail. Development teams can confidently move forward on most tasks, with just occasional clarification needed. Implementation risks are minimal.",

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Throws around buzzwords like 'engagement' and 'delighting users' without defining what they mean or how they'll be measured. Metrics chosen seem arbitrary and disconnected from business outcomes.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Acknowledges the need for measurement but remains frustratingly vague. Mentions 'improved performance' without specifying targets or measurement approaches. Shows awareness of metrics but lacks follow-through.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Defines clear success metrics for most key areas with specific targets. Measurement methodologies mostly explained, though a few metrics could use more precise definitions or benchmarks.",
          "Absolutely Zero BS": "A metrics masterclass with specific, quantifiable success criteria tied directly to business outcomes. Includes exact targets (e.g., '15% increase in retention') with crystal clear measurement methodologies and tracking plans."

          "Fair Amount of BS": "The collaboration equivalent of a dictator asking 'any questions?' at the end of a speech. Other teams' perspectives are fundamentally misunderstood, creating serious disconnects between expectations and reality.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Shows signs of obligatory, last-minute input gathering. Engineering comments tacked on rather than integrated, design considerations superficial. Like asking for feedback after the decision's already been made.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Reflects genuine collaboration with most key stakeholders, though some perspectives (like customer support or sales) may be underrepresented. Most cross-functional concerns addressed before finalization.",
          "Absolutely Zero BS": "A symphony of cross-functional collaboration with documented input from all relevant teams. Every stakeholder's expertise visibly incorporated and acknowledged. The document itself demonstrates how to build alignment."

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Drowning in unnecessary detail and repetition. Reading it feels like being trapped in a meeting that should have been an email, which itself should have been a text message. Information density approaching zero.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Contains useful information but buried under layers of fluff. Stakeholders will skim sections, potentially missing important details hidden between unnecessary paragraphs. Needs an editor with a heavy hand.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Generally concise with only occasional wordiness. Information well-organized enough that stakeholders can quickly find what they need without wading through irrelevance.",

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Priorities shift like sand dunes in a windstorm. What's critical on page 2 seems forgotten by page 4. Stakeholders frequently contradict earlier prioritization without explanation, making planning impossible.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Attempts prioritization but creates confusion with multiple conflicting 'must-haves' without clear rationale. Like being told ten different things are 'the most important' without explanation of why or in what order.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Provides clear prioritization for most features with reasonable justification. A few items lack explicit ranking explanations, but teams would generally understand what to tackle first and why.",
          "Absolutely Zero BS": "Prioritization so clear it could be taught in business schools. Features precisely ranked with compelling rationale for each decision. Distinguishes between 'must-have' and 'nice-to-have' with crystal clear criteria that everyone can understand."

          "Fair Amount of BS": "Superficial observations anyone could make from a 5-minute Google search. No real segmentation, trend analysis, or proprietary insights. The equivalent of saying 'people like easy-to-use products' and calling it analysis.",
          "Some BS Detected": "Shows basic understanding of the market landscape but relies heavily on generalizations. Limited supporting data and customer insights feel anecdotal rather than systematic.",
          "Mostly BS Free": "Presents solid market analysis with good research backing most conclusions. Some areas could go deeper, particularly around emerging opportunities or more nuanced customer segments.",
